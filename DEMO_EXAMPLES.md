# Demo Examples: Sequential Iteration Story

A realistic demonstration of how prompt engineering improves outputs step-by-step.

## The Scenario
You're analyzing adverse event data from a clinical trial for a new migraine treatment. Each iteration addresses a specific problem with the previous output and shows how to improve it.

## Iteration 1: Initial Analysis (Too Generic)

**Problem:** The AI gives a vague, unfocused analysis that doesn't help with decision-making.

**Actual Run 1 Output:** "In this Phase 2 study, 23 of 84 patients (27.4%) reported at least one adverse event (AE) during the 12-week treatment period. The most frequently reported AEs were headache (n=12), nausea (n=8), and fatigue (n=6). The incidence of these AEs was generally mild to moderate in severity. No serious adverse events (SAEs) or treatment-related discontinuations due to AEs were reported. A complete listing of all AEs and their individual frequencies is provided in Appendix X. Further analysis is required to determine the relationship, if any, between these AEs and study treatment."

**Why this is inadequate:** Generic language, no prioritization of concerns, no actionable insights, references to non-existent appendices.

**Fix - Task Component:**
```
Analyze the adverse events in this mock TLF dataset and identify the three most concerning safety signals.
```

**Expected Improvement:** Focused analysis that highlights specific safety concerns with clear prioritization.

---

## Iteration 2: Add Clinical Expertise (Too Basic)

**Problem:** The analysis lacks clinical depth and doesn't identify subtle patterns that a medical expert would notice.

**Expected Output:** "The three most concerning events are headache (14.3%), nausea (9.5%), and fatigue (7.1%)."

**Why this is inadequate:** Just lists numbers without clinical interpretation, risk assessment, or pattern recognition.

**Fix - Persona Component:**
```
You are a clinical safety specialist with 15+ years of experience in pharmacovigilance. You excel at identifying subtle safety patterns and communicating risks clearly.
```

**Expected Improvement:** Expert-level analysis that identifies patterns, assesses clinical significance, and provides risk context.

---

## Iteration 3: Add Study Context (Missing Background)

**Problem:** The analysis doesn't consider the study population or design, leading to potentially misleading conclusions.

**Expected Output:** "Headache (14.3%) and nausea (9.5%) are concerning. Fatigue (7.1%) requires monitoring."

**Why this is inadequate:** Doesn't account for patient demographics, study duration, or baseline characteristics that affect interpretation.

**Fix - Context Component:**
```
This is data from a 12-week Phase 2 study with 84 patients diagnosed with moderate to severe symptoms. The study population included 60% women, average age 45, with no significant comorbidities.
```

**Expected Improvement:** Contextualized analysis that considers the specific patient population and study limitations.

---

## Iteration 4: Structure the Output (Poor Organization)

**Problem:** The analysis is well-informed but poorly organized, making it hard to extract key information quickly.

**Expected Output:** "Based on the 12-week Phase 2 study with 84 patients (60% women, average age 45), the most concerning safety signals are headache (14.3%), nausea (9.5%), and fatigue (7.1%). These rates are higher than expected for this population. Clinical monitoring is recommended."

**Why this is inadequate:** Information is scattered and lacks clear structure for different stakeholders.

**Fix - Output Format Component:**
```
Format your response as:
1. Overall Safety Assessment: [brief overview]
2. Most Common Events: [list top 3 with percentages]
3. Serious Concerns: [any significant risks]
4. Recommendations: [key actions needed]
```

**Expected Improvement:** Well-organized, scannable output that allows rapid identification of key findings.

---

## Iteration 5: Add Regulatory Focus (Wrong Audience)

**Problem:** The analysis is clinically sound but not formatted for regulatory submission requirements.

**Expected Output:** 
```
1. Overall Safety Assessment: Safety profile shows manageable adverse events
2. Most Common Events: Headache (14.3%), nausea (9.5%), fatigue (7.1%)
3. Serious Concerns: No serious adverse events reported
4. Recommendations: Continue monitoring, consider dose adjustment
```

**Why this is inadequate:** Doesn't meet FDA submission standards or regulatory documentation requirements.

**Fix - Persona Component:**
```
You are a regulatory affairs professional preparing safety assessments for FDA submission. You focus on compliance, accuracy, and meeting regulatory standards.
```

**Expected Improvement:** Regulatory-compliant analysis with appropriate terminology and documentation standards.

---

## Iteration 6: Add Statistical Rigor (Missing Analysis)

**Problem:** The regulatory analysis lacks statistical depth needed for scientific review and regulatory scrutiny.

**Expected Output:** "The safety profile demonstrates acceptable tolerability with headache (14.3%, 95% CI: 7.5-21.1%) as the most common event. No serious adverse events were reported during the 12-week study period."

**Why this is inadequate:** Lacks statistical analysis, confidence intervals, and comparative risk assessment.

**Fix - Constraints Component:**
```
Provide detailed technical analysis with medical terminology. Include statistical significance, confidence intervals, and comparative risk assessments. Limit to 300 words.
```

**Expected Improvement:** Comprehensive statistical analysis suitable for regulatory review and scientific publication.

---

## Iteration 7: Add Risk-Benefit Context (Incomplete Picture)

**Problem:** The analysis focuses only on safety without considering the treatment's efficacy benefits.

**Expected Output:** "Statistical analysis shows headache (14.3%, 95% CI: 7.5-21.1%) and nausea (9.5%, 95% CI: 3.2-15.8%) as primary adverse events. No serious events reported."

**Why this is inadequate:** Doesn't balance safety concerns against efficacy benefits for complete risk-benefit assessment.

**Fix - Context Component:**
```
This adverse event data comes from a clinical trial that showed 23% higher efficacy than standard treatment, but safety profile evaluation is critical for regulatory approval.
```

**Expected Improvement:** Balanced risk-benefit analysis that supports treatment decision-making and regulatory review.

---

## Iteration 8: Final Patient Communication (Wrong Format)

**Problem:** The regulatory analysis is too technical for patient education and informed consent materials.

**Expected Output:** "The treatment showed 23% better efficacy than standard care. Common side effects include headache (14%) and nausea (10%), which are typically mild and manageable."

**Why this is inadequate:** Too technical and doesn't help patients make informed decisions about their treatment.

**Fix - Persona Component:**
```
You are a patient safety advocate who translates complex medical data into clear, understandable insights that prioritize patient welfare and informed decision-making.
```

**Expected Improvement:** Patient-appropriate communication that helps with informed consent and shared decision-making.
